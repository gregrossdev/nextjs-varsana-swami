Dear Srila Prabhupada,

Please accept my humble obeisances. All glories to the most blessed event of your Vyasa-puja.

Today we worship you, who appear as the representative of Krsna's literary incarnation.

The spiritual potency of this occasion enriches our reflection on your life and your instructions.

And, when we have the opportunity to glorify you,

Srila Prabhupada, every aspect of life is imbued with meaning and purpose.

With each passing year, I am relishing even more... how your words never fail to impart deep peace and inspiration to my soul.

I write to you today from Bahulaban in New Vrndavan Dhama. This village of historical glory is now in ruins due to Sri Radha-Vrndavana-Candra's relocating to Their new temple and Their devotees naturally following behind. Yet remembrance of you makes your presence here all the more vivid, both within my heart and in the dhama that surrounds me in a loving embrace.

Today I reflect specifically on your Vrndavana-bhajana and the image of you:

_“...sitting alone in Vrndavana dhama ...”_

_I am drawn to consider your words:_

_“Everyone has abandoned me, seeing me penniless..._

_...where are all my elders?..._

_All that is left of this family life is a list of names.”_

_This sets the scene for the assurance which follows:_

_“Seen in relationship to Krsna, they are all in harmony.”_

_I sit here alone in Bahulaban._

_Decades have passed, new faces come and gone._

_Thousands have participated in building New Vrndavan, each with a story of their own._

_Where are they now? I miss them all,_

_And nature speaks in a way to affirm the depth of loss._

_I am left here with little more than a list of names._

_So I cling to remembrance of specific pastimes that most articulate your precepts._

_In my mind's eye, the blurry pages of history turn back, until one exquisite event crystallizes, as real today as it was back then._

_Echoes of bygone kirtanas remain impressed upon the ether... sometimes whispering audibly as the wind rustles through the trees outside..._

_In my chronicles of hope, it is now Janmastami, the appearance of Sri Krsna, 1972._

_You are here, presiding over the festivities, demonstrating the proper mood for worshiping the Lord._

_Into the late hours of the night_

_You display the ideal of complete absorption in hearing and chanting the glories and pastimes of the Lord._

_At midnight, all things adjust to a deeper harmony; a shift transpires._

_It is now Nandotsava, the time Sri Krsna saw in His infinite wisdom and kindness_

_to be the auspicious day for your appearance._

_On this day Sri Krsna, in the form of Radha-Damodara, preside over the occasion._

_In reciprocation with your loving emotions, Krsna awakens in us the appropriate feelings to properly worship you._

_Then Krsna showers us with the precious realization:_

_He delights in seeing His representative honored._

_Gradually the divine adjustment of all components becomes tangible:_

_Sri Nama takes root in New Vrndavan Dhama, offering the setting._

_Janmastami overlaps with Sri Vyasa-puja to unite as one festival of devotional expression._

_Each aspect illumines yet another face of Krsna's benevolence, a love too vast to be contained exclusively in His own heart, too inconceivable for us to serve._

_So yearning to expand, to facilitate relationship, Krsna assumes various personal forms._

_That day Nama and Dhama, Guru and Krsna, four distinct cornerstones of Truth,_

_always individual yet interdependent in nurturing our understanding,_

_collaborated to reveal Their divine interactions._

_Many seasons have now passed, and I sit here in silent solitude, holding a list of names._

_I might be discouraged if not for your words:_

_“Seen in relationship to Krsna, they are all in harmony.” Recognizing the most lovable person, whose unseen hand guides our mysterious destinies,_

_working in and through all things to draw out our ultimate welfare,_

_our inner eye opens to the heart of Vyasa-puja._

_Bhakti is the only food for the soul,_

_Rasa alone can refresh the heart,_

_and the Holy Name continues to resound, reviving our very life breath._

_Your vani is the treasure of my soul, and its influence is unspeakable through mere lip service._

_Your mood, your words, your deeds exemplify the ideal disciple... who is our perfect master._

Please bless us with your darsana, in the realms of separation, where we honor the essence within the form of Sri Vyasa-puja.

Aspiring to attain the service of your servants,

Varsana Swami
