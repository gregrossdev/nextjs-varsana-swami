title: Relationship with Self and Lord's Measuring Stick

When the enemy fires cannonballs or incites mad elephants to attack, what softens their assault more effectively than the hard barriers we have erected to protect our hearts? Bales of cotton stop cannonballs that would smash through stone walls, and little lambs pacify a maddened elephant who would crush armored defenses. The lamb symbolizes our relationship with God, and the cotton bail signifies our proper dealings with mankind, which means gentle and soft. The imagery conveys and cultivates an attitude that is humble and meek and thus able to withstand and deflate the blunt assaults of the devil.

 Why is the term "meek and humble" so crucial to our vocabulary when the two words might seem to be synonymous and thus redundant? Internally related - yes; synonymous â€“ no. We initially say humility sets the standard for our attitude towards God, whereas meek is how the Lord intends we interact with mankind. 

 Amongst the significant members of mankind with whom our interactions forge character, our relationship with self requires meekness to protect oneself from itself. How brutally some of us measure and mistreat ourselves because of our human imperfections! The rational faculty of the head dictates that we become upset at ourselves for our ill-temper towards others, whereby the heart is repeatedly scorched by successive flames of passion.

Truly, we should be more strict in evaluating ourselves than others. Yet, we must set boundaries to this standard according to the Lord's measuring stick. His stick compensates our limitations with His divine mercy. Coupled with the Goddess of grace, who not only allows for imperfections but also appears and serves in and through them, especially when we treat her servants with meekness.

 Why, then, are we so strongly tempted to be discouraged by our weakness, hopeless when we face depression, and gloomy at the mere sight of clouds in the distance of our emotional landscape?

These exaggerated expectations towards oneself are born of self-love and thus lead to false pride. They are the lure of the illusory energy to keep us overwhelmed in the seemingly impossible negatives and thus distracted and unappreciative of the positive cleansing virtues of bhakti. By contemplating how God's glory is often best expressed in man's weakness, we can cultivate hope in a life of grace. Understanding that being annoyed at our tendencies towards anger invites new passions to follow, we might perhaps consider forgiveness instead.

 Seeing our imperfections can be an invitation to the region of the heart, which, unlike the rational faculty of the head, is not judgmental. On the contrary, the heart is the realm of Bhakti, who is patient, kind, loving, and gentle. Therefore, Bhakti-devi is pleased when Her servants express Her virtues and proceed towards perfection in becoming an instrument, measured by the master's yardstick and not by our own limited, imperfect, and rigid standards.
