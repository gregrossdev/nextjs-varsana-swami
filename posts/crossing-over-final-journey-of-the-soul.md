The pinnacle of spiritual and emotional growth is accentuated by the psychological depths of loss. The rock bottom found in the depths of the abyss indicates the point where the inner transformation may occur, and a new life is ready to begin. Our desire to turn a life around, re-examine what matters most, and shift obsolete attitudes and judgments, is most apparent when anguish reaches its deepest point, and the only option is the upward path.

The dualities of conditional life reflect the variegated nature of transcendental reality. By experiencing only joy without ever tasting sorrow, by knowing only light without emerging from darkness, our appreciation for the most precious gifts of life would diminish, and our potential remain thereby restricted. 

A river naturally flows at the bottom of a valley, and crossing it means and necessitates leaving behind unnecessary items. Similarly, when we feel plunged into the depths of despair, "crossing over" requires dropping off our old identity, outer shells, burdensome accumulations, and leaving behind our attachments and their accompanying pain and restrictions. This will lighten our load in preparation for the upward climb awaiting us on the other side, an ascent to the brighter side.  

The rich and varied elements involved in crossing a river are worthy of our contemplation. In the landscape of inner meaning, rivers represent the flow of universal potentiality. They are essential to the ritual of cleansing and restoration as a prelude to the fecundity which naturally awaits on "the other side."

The experience of crossing the river awakens the memory of the soul's final journey as it crosses the Viraja, Causal Ocean, which divides the material creation from the spiritual world. On the far shore of Viraja lies the brahmajyoti, not an inhabitable region but yet another realm to be crossed. Then there is the Mount of Kailash, after which awaits aisvarya-dhama (Vaikuntha), and finally madhurya-dhama (Goloka Vrindavan).

 We repeatedly hear that we must "die to live," which implies the death of false ego and material attachments. Finding ourselves naked and vulnerable, we fear entering the casual waters flowing in the Viraja River that represent new life and spiritual birth. We need help and encouragement from those who have gone before us and they are still living and accessible in a world of sound, inspiring us to follow in their footsteps.

Sacred sound instills faith - the promise of all that is hoped for and the conviction of that which is yet unseen. Faith awakens our soul to the realization that the kingdom of our dreams is not to be found in some far-off distant realm. It exists forever in the core of the heart when it is opened to perceive and achieve the goal. 

As our sadhana awards purification, we become more attuned to the heart's inner perception and awaken in the dawn light of our homeland. Our journey progresses in successive steps toward the sacred soil of our cherished destination. Yet the old world of our physical life keeps calling us back with familiar sights and sounds, pleasures and pains, along with joyful and sorrowful memories. Though lacking in fulfillment, the land of our physical birth is a temporary part of us, forming the very bone and marrow of our false identity and outer self. Our attachment to it holds us captive and beckons us to turn back.

Fortified and protected in our new garments of spiritual vestige, we venture a little further each day. With each step, we feel more at home in the kingdom of life and love, more attracted to take residence there, and less inclined to turn back to the present world of selfishness, illusion, and death. Stepping out from the depths of pain and loss within material nature and proceeding into the perfection of our journeys' purpose, we pass into the company of those who have gone before us, now living within the association of the spiritual nature.
