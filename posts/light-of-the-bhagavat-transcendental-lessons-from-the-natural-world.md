The wonders of nature have intrigued the minds of poets, theologians, and philosophers alike since time immemorial. Yet their combined efforts to comprehend and articulate her ultimate mysteries fall short compared to the writings of Srila Prabhupada, the transparent medium to the Source of the natural world. As we read Srila Prabhupada's words, we can hear Krishna's message, see His beauty, feel His love, and receive His mercy as they reflect and echo throughout every aspect of His creation.

Srila Prabhupada composed the book "Light of the Bhagavat: Transcendental Lessons from the Natural World" in 1961 in Vrindavan in preparation for his hope to attend an international conference in Japan called the Congress for Cultivating the Human Spirit. Anticipating that he would have only a limited time to speak, Srila Prabhupada contemplated how best to convey the eternal truth of sanatana-dharma.

Most of the conference participants would be from the Far East, mainly Japan. Their cultures, along with the culture of India, were amongst the oldest in the world. Thus Srila Prabhupada contemplated a blend that would allow his message to be heard.

He was aware that people from the far East had respect for nature and that they held an appreciation for autumn as a particularly beautiful time. Thus he decided to present the eternal spiritual truths of Srimad Bhagavatam through various examples from nature.

For example, the dark cloudy evening of the rainy autumn season when no stars are visible is compared to the present materialistic, godless civilization in which the bright stars of the Bhagavat's wisdom (meaning both devotees and scriptures) are temporarily obscured.

Srila Prabhupada translated 48 verses from Srimad Bhagavatam's "Description of Autumn" and illumined those texts with his purports, granting a glimpse of the natural world through the vision of a Krishna Conscious person. He planned to inspire the conference organizers to find an artist in Japan to illustrate each verse. He wrote directions from which an artist would be able to design each painting, wanting to have "Light of the Bhagavat" completed in time for the conference in Japan.

Unfortunate circumstances impeded Srila Prabhupada's trip, and he was unable to attend the conference. Consequently, "Light of the Bhagavat" did not see the light of day until after he disappeared from this world.

My godbrother Hanumat Presaka Swami gives an enlightening presentation on Srila Prabhupada's "Light of the Bhagavat."

For those who appreciate the natural world and seek to become more in tune with it, I highly recommend reading "Light of the Bhagavat”, especially during Kartik month. The book opens our eyes and ears to the glorious Source of the natural beauty reflected around us.
