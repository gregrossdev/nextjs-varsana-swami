Maha-maya_,_ the goddess of material energy, activates the unlimited worlds and keeps the jiva souls bound in the shackles of passion and ignorance. She is very subtle yet extremely powerful.

So perfect is the illusion she casts over the conditioned souls that not a single person even _wants_ to escape from the prison-house of material existence. We are so attached to our chains and bondage that we feel no desire for true freedom. This is quite a contrast from the prison houses created by man, where someone always attempts to break free. How powerful the goddess of the material energy is and how bewildering is her spell!

Maha-maya separates the living entity from the Lord's shelter by deluding him into thinking that he is the independent enjoyer, controller, and proprietor. However, as the expansion of the goddess of _bhakti_ who reigns over the spiritual sky, Mayadevi ultimately desires our deliverance from material clutches. She is both our imprisoner and our well-wisher.

Her counterpart, Yoga-maya, the spiritual potency of the Lord, facilitates the union between the individual souls and Krishna. Both maha-maya and yoga-maya serve Krishna and govern jivas according to their desires and are in truth different faces of the same person.

The face we see is determined by the lens we look through, which could be exploitative or devotional according to our attitude. If that lens is the crystal-clear glass of being the humble servant of the servant, then everything and everyone will reveal the ultimate feature of the Lord's internal energy and yoga-maya will make the arrangements for us to reconcile with Him and return to His shelter.

By their example, the great souls teach us how we must interact with one another and with the whole environment in order to evoke the divine nature, yoga-maya, to reveal herself as she is. Until we are deeply steeped in an attitude of humility, we need to realize material nature (maha-maya) for what she is. We must respect the concept of the inferior (material) nature as the response of Durga, Mother Parvati, to our rebellious mentality, manifested by our desires to enjoy, control and exploit.

We need to practice here and now how to rectify this mentality. By interacting with everything as being essentially and inherently divine, we acknowledge that the inferior nature has a divine face and our respect for her grows. We will gradually perceive yoga-maya's enlightening aspect taking precedence over her inferior, deluding feature.

Assuming the role of mother, she prepares us for going back to the land where there is no false ego, no sense of proprietorship, and where service is the predominant mentality directing the lives and activities of both the Lord and His servants.
