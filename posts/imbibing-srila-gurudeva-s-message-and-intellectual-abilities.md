Editor’s note: This article is a compilation of excerpts from Varsana Maharaja’s lectures.

                                    

We need to listen attentively and inquire sufficiently in order to understand Sri Guru’s message. Any misunderstanding or misrepresentation of gurudeva’s guidance may manifest in a betrayal which is, in effect, a betrayal of oneself.

The desire to imbibe his message in our hearts must be carefully fortified with strict _sadhana_ and humility, which impart divine protection and revelation. We must further beseech the _guru’s_ blessings through sincere prayers, dedicated service, and a devotional lifestyle.

Our realization and relationship with _guru_ and Krishna has little to do with intellectual abilities or philosophical understanding, unless and until it develops into faith, humility, sincere following, and ultimately love. Mind and intellect have limited value. They will not suffice for protecting us and guiding us back to Godhead. Realized, spiritual understanding is desired, not a mere intellectual one.

We need to sincerely apply what we have heard and understood in humble service and sacrifice. Knowledge must be enriched with humility, then realization follows giving root to empowerment. Academic credentials stacked up in the head can be detrimental, and if pride results, it will become a serious obstacle in our devotional progress.

Not to minimize hearing or studying the scriptures, but those activities should be done with humble faith and submission in order to reach the core of the heart. Intellect is useful in understanding the necessity of surrender, but ultimately, it is only through a very humble submission of the heart that the essence of truth can be conveyed.

Knowledge must descend into the heart. Humility, the key to the portals of the heart, allows it to become realized in proper relationship to the environment; meaning the Lord, living entities, and the entire creation. _Sambhanda_, the first of the cardinal truths of _vaisnava_ theology, is the beginning of the cultivation of realized knowledge. It finds its application in _abhideya_, where _bhakti_ is the expression, and continues on to _prayojana_, pure love of God. This pure love includes a love of everyone and a genuine service attitude towards all living beings and all creation.

In this process of purification, our realization of gurudeva's mission matures, eventually finding application in every aspect of our lives. When we make a commitment to his words and engrave his instructions in our hearts, we will hear and see his divine message resounding throughout everyone and everything in creation. Everything we say or do, every interaction we have, will become a living reality where our gurudeva is with us at all times.

It was once said that if you have many gurus you have no guru. But if you truly and submissively dedicate yourself to one guru, then you have many gurus. A surrendered soul sees guru as the helping hand extending from Krishna to direct and reconnect us with Him. It all begins by accepting gurudeva’s message as one’s very life and soul, and carefully protecting that relationship as the most precious sacrament in the core of the heart.

Srila Prabhupada did not have many meetings with his guru maharaja nor did he receive many instructions. Though his association with his guru may have been short in regards of quantity, Prabhupada ensured that it was of the utmost quality, for he took those few instructions to his heart and dedicated his life to bring them into fruition. In return, the Lord blessed him with empowerment and realization of how to succeed and fulfill Caitanya Mahaprabhu's mission.

Before Srila Prabhupada’s arrival in America, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati had sent other sanyasis who were vastly learned to the west. Yet it was Srila Prabhupada's firm faith in his guru maharaja's instruction, his dedication and willingness to sacrifice, and his dependence on the Holy Name, that were exemplary and eclipsed any academic learning.

Consequently, Lord Caitanya chose Srila Prabhupada to fulfill His plan, desire and prophecy that, “In as many towns and villages there are on the surface on the earth, my holy name shall be sung.” Srila Prabhupada responded, “When the holy name resounds from every river, stream, ocean, forest, hill, valley and meadow, then the true vaisnava’s desire is fulfilled.”
