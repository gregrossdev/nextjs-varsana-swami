In Bhagavad Gita, 9.17, Lord Krishna says, “I am the father of this universe, the mother, the support, and the grandsire.”

In Sri Chaitanya Bhagavata, Madhya-kanda, Chapter 18, Verse 202, Srila Vrindavan das Thakur illuminates Krishna’s words: “The Lord felt the same affectionate attachment for the devotees as a mother feels for her child. He then gave everyone the same feelings a child has for his mother.”

In the purport, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati carefully brings this principle a step further, making it relevant to conditioned souls. He writes, “It is seen in the ideal example of a mother in this world when her child accepts service from her, the child is unable to properly reciprocate because of its undeveloped consciousness. When a mother serves her child like a maidservant, her child cannot serve her at that time. When the child’s consciousness matures and becomes an adult, he may develop a  desire to become the master. This master attitude prevents him from understanding that his mother has been serving him all these years, and thus he should clear this debt  by serving her.”

The natural implication of Saraswati Thakur’s purport is that only when the child becomes genuinely grateful for the service he receives from his earthly parents he can appreciate the blessings of the Supreme Mother and Father.

When Lord Caitanya informed those devotees who are most near and dear to Him of His plan to take sannyasa, the devotees were tossed about in the ocean of despair. Deeply aggrieved and already feeling the anguish of imminent separation, they wept bitterly and lost all interest in eating, sleeping, and other daily activities.

However, when Mother Sacidevi heard the news, her grief was more intense than the others. So intense was her despair that all the pain of the entire universe could not compare to the anguish of her heart.

Hearing that her Son intended to take sannyasa, she fainted. Even in that unconscious condition, tears continually flowed from her eyes, creating a heart-rending sight. Upon returning to consciousness, she cried out to Nimai, “My darling Son, please do not leave Your mother. You have descended to teach everyone the principles of religion. What religion teaches one to leave his mother? You are the embodiment of religious principles, and if you forsake Your mother, how can You teach the world about religion?” ( Sri Caitanya Bhagavata Madyha-lila, Ch. 27)

Seeing His mother rampaged by the storm of grief, the Lord revealed to her some precious secrets to pacify her. He confided, “Mother, please calm yourself and listen. I have eternally been your Son in each one of My births. When you were Prishni, I was your son Prishni Garbha. Later, when you took birth in the heavenly planets as Aditi, I became your son Vamana. When you were Devahuti, I was Kapila. When you were Kausalya, I became Rama. When you were Devaki, imprisoned in the dungeon of wicked Kamsa, I became your son, Krishna. And in this life, I am your son in two forms. You are the mother of my Deity form as well as the mother of the Holy Name. So, please see that I can never leave you, and I will forever be your child. I reveal this to you confidentially. May these truths allay your fears and grief.” (Sri Caitanya Bhagavata, Madhya Kandha, Ch. 27)"

After accepting the renounced order, Caitanya Mahaprabhu was determined to go to Vrindavan. However, because the separation would have cost the devotees their lives, Sri Nityananda tricked the Lord into going to Santipur instead. Caitanya Mahaprabhu called the devotees to join Him there, so Mother Saci came with them to meet her Son. In public and full view of everyone, she took Him on her lap, embracing and kissing Him. In ecstasy, the Lord declared, “Oh, Mata, I should not have taken sannyasa. I was overcome by some impulse of madness.”

The turbulence raging in the hearts of His devotees indicated a deeper conflict within the Lord’s mind. He was torn between the irresistible attraction toward the Lord of Vrindavan and love for His mother in Navadvip. The resolution of this conflict rested on the verdict of Sacidevi, before whom Nimai placed two options: either He would proceed to Vrindavan with her blessings if she chose to grant them; or else He would forfeit His pilgrimage and remain in Nadia, close to Sacimata.

The Lord addressed His mother, “I never asked your permission to take sannyasa. You gave Me life and nourished Me through childhood, and all that I have is due to your kindness. So now, whatever you like, I will do whether it means staying at home or going to Vrindavan.”

If the Lord went to Vrindavan, that would deprive his devotees of hearing about Him, which was the source of their lives. For a sannyasi to return to his mother’s home would subject him to extreme criticism that the devotees, especially Mother Saci, would find unbearable. Thus finding neither option acceptable, Sacimata posed an alternative that integrated both possibilities the Lord had placed before her. She began, “The same Krishna Who resides eternally in Vrindavan is simultaneously presiding in Jagannath Puri. Puri and Vrindavan are like two rooms in the same house with people coming and going from one room to the other, bearing news between them.”

As pilgrims continually move between Puri and Navadwip, news of the Lord’s pastimes in Jagannath Puri would naturally reach the devotees in Nadia and would thereby sustain their lives. Thus Sacimata appealed to her Son to make His residence in Jagannath Puri.

Accepting Mother Saci’s order to be a Vedic injunction, Lord Caitanya complied and made His residence in Jagannath Puri. The result was just as Mother Saci had predicted: their lives were sustained and further nourished beyond measure by the nectar of gaura-katha.

This same nectar, enshrined in the pages of Caitanya-caritamrita, sustained Srila Prabhupada’s life during the challenges he faced on his journey to America. And by distributing that nectar to all the world, Srila Prabhupada changed the course of history. Thus Srila Vrindavan das Thakur sings in great exultation that fortunate souls can still, by hearing, see Lord Caitanya’s pastimes unfolding even today.
