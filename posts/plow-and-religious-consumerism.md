The sanctity of a plow is reflected in the response Jesus offered to the aspiring disciple who was distracted by worldly considerations.

Jesus established, “No one, having put his hand to the plow and thereafter looks back, is fit for the kingdom of God.” In other words, he emphasizes total dedication and clear focus over selective following with a pick-and-choose mentality. This addresses the anarthas known as religious consumerism, which mainly refers to two items; what pleases my senses and what pleases the masses.

For example, in choosing a guru, the consumer mentality leads us to evaluate him based on how he makes us feel versus how he pleases Krishna.

Our intentions should be pleasing guru and Krishna over and above appealing to the masses or ego, whereby the potency of our mission would be compromised (watered down). Because when we try to cater to the masses, we may lose our focus on pleasing and representing Sri Guru and Krishna properly.

Furthermore, beating swords into plowshares foretells times of peace and harmony. Whereas melting plows down to make weapons is a warning of upcoming conflict and war.
