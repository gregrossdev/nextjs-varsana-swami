Archetypes and My Snake Fiend 

 

To a varying extent, some ancient and most indigenous civilizations lived harmoniously with the natural order. A life in tune with nature promotes receptivity to the influence of the world of symbols.

 

Modern man is significantly challenged in his ability to live in harmony with the surrounding world. Since the industrial revolution, most of the human population has been living "uprooted" lives, disconnected from the deeper regions of ourselves and the planet where the true wisdom is found. Moreover,  toxic waste has increased exponentially in the individual and collective minds, dulling one's ability to perceive, acknowledge, and respond to the archetypes.

 

Archetypes reveal the unfolding patterns of the universe, the patterns. These patterns support living in tune with God's creation, calling upon humans to live consciously and with awareness. Archetypes initially direct us out of hell and urge us to find our place in the material world. Later, we are faced with many options, and archetypes point out the proper path for us. Ultimately, they direct us back home, back to Godhead.   In bygone times, human society was organized consistently with these patterns and incorporated samskaras, rites of entry, and other rituals that encouraged living in accord with the archetypes.

 

Archetypes are stored in the collective subconscious, located in various layers of the planet earth, which is both the collective mind and body of humanity. The archetypal world communicates through symbols that trigger emotional, spiritual, and physical responses. For example, a garden symbolizes paradise, heaven on Earth, and our original state of innocence; therefore, it confers a sense of peace. Another example is the cross, an intersection between horizontal and vertical axes, which symbolizes the junction between divinity and mortality. 

A snake is one of the most commonly symbolized creatures throughout human history; and across various cultures. For some people, the snake represents evil, death, the devil, and all things scary and dark. For others, they symbolize wisdom, renewal, transformation, healing, environmental sensitivity, and even the nurturing earth, to name a few. Snakes regenerate from the inside out by shedding old, uncomfortable layers that no longer serve them. They serve as a reminder to ask ourselves. What do I want to let go off? What does not help me anymore?

Consequently, a snake is an archetypal complex that may represent various things depending on the context and specific snake's nature. The good snake symbolizes something living in the subconscious, wanting to come out to the light, yet still hidden in the darkness.

 

In Kali-yuga, much of the academic and intellectual knowledge we are bombarded with daily remains abstract. Due to its abstraction, it cannot be assimilated and therefore overwhelms almost anyone, especially children.    

 

I could not engage in that kind of abstract learning as a child. As a genuine earthling, I was very much attuned to symbology, the language of the archetypes. Even then, I understood that the modern educational institution is an arm or branch of the corporate world and that its purpose is to condition children to become cogs in the corporate wheel. I was not very receptive to that kind of education and valued the lessons from the natural world more than those imposed upon me by unnatural institutions.     

 

My auntie happened to be an English teacher. She was also my teacher in school, and she tried to teach me things like adjectives, pronouns, and synonyms. It was a very abstract lesson because it had no connection to the natural world, the only world I could relate to. I couldn't see what she was talking about, so I became overwhelmed and began nodding off.

 

So, as I was, sitting in English class, struggling to stay awake, the teacher was very frustrated with me because I could not understand the academic approach to language. But that was not the language that I spoke or understood. So I tried to understand, but it was too overwhelming, and I fell asleep. Then a message came from the collective subconscious to direct me to my place in the unfolding patterns of the universe.

On my way to school that morning, I made a new friend - one of the harmless, native snakes commonly found in the woods. He seemed eager to be friends with me, too, wrapping himself around my arm and ready to accompany me in my adventures that day. Since attending school was first on the agenda, I decided to bring my reptilian friend along. After that educational obligation was fulfilled, I thought the two of us could entertain ourselves nicely the rest of the day.

Once I arrived at school, I kept him safely and comfortably housed inside the desk, which had a hole on the top surface to serve as an inkwell. Sensing my inattention as I dozed, he slowly raised his serpentine head, tongue flashing in and out. Then, my snake friend slithered farther up and out using the inkwell as his portal (and out from the collective subconscious). As he raised his head higher by standing more erect, my fellow students were the first to notice him. Those who knew me well found this to be typical of my classroom challenges and behavior. Those who were not so accustomed ty my habits raised the alarm. Meanwhile, the snake rose higher above the desk because he was concerned that there was something wrong as I was not interacting with him. At this point, he saw that I was sound asleep, and in response, he brushed my chin with the tip of his tongue to wake me up. 

Seeing her challenged student so peacefully seated face to face with a serpent, the teacher found this to be the most inappropriate behavior for her orderly classroom. Alarmed, she exclaimed, "Either that snake goes, or you go!" Delighted at this turn of events, I responded, "I will go." 

At this point, my friend was still standing up straight. So, I reached out my arm beside him, and he gently wrapped around my wrist; we exited the confines of the educational institutionalism and together entered into the sunlight of the beautiful spring morning. And where did we go? Right back to the forest where he had first adopted me â€” the natural classroom of Mother Earth. There we learned many beautiful lessons together. 

Purport to the story. If we overly focus on the academic perspectives only, we may well miss the rich lessons awaiting in the realm of archetypes.
