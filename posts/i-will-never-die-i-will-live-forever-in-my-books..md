When Srila Prabhupada was on his departure bed in Vrindavan, India, in 1977, he assured his young disciples, “I will never die. I will live forever in my books.” Srila Prabhupada is fully present in his books and available to all who follow in his footsteps.   

The Palace of Gold, which is Srila Prabhupada’s samadhi, enshrines one of the original volumes of Srimad Bhagavatam written in India on the order of his spiritual master. 

Srila Prabhupada illustrated this truth when he wrote to one of his disciples on December 27, 1974, “Vaisnava is never alone. When I first came to the United States, I was seemingly alone for one year. But I never felt alone. I always felt the presence of my Guru Maharaja. Myself, I was cooking, I was printing books, I was selling books, everything seemingly alone. But I did not lose my determination. So you should know that you are never alone.”

Srila Prabhupada first met his spiritual master, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati, in Calcutta in 1922. At that first meeting, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati instructed Srila Prabhupada to distribute India’s ancient Vedic spiritual knowledge throughout the English-speaking world. He accepted his spiritual master’s instruction deep within his heart. Later in 1933, on the bank of Radha Kunda, Srila Bhaktisiddhanta Saraswati instructed Srila Prabhupada, “If you ever get money, print books.”

Accepting his spiritual master’s instruction wholeheartedly, Srila Prabhupada spent the next three decades preparing to make the treacherous journey to the West. In 1950, at the age of fifty-four, he retired from family life, and several years later, he moved to Vrindavan. There Srila Prabhupada began his life’s work, an English version of the Srimad Bhagavatam with complete word-for-word translations and elaborate purports. 

In 1965, Srila Prabhupada’s complete, three-volume set of the First Canto of Srimad Bhagavatam was printed and ready for distribution. He considered this sufficient scriptural support to make the journey to America. Never before had a pure devotee of Krsna left Vrindavan to cross the ocean, venturing to foreign lands of fearful, agitated men. The American population was utterly unfamiliar with the divine message Srila Prabhupada carried.   

On August 13, 1965, Srila Prabhupada boarded the Jaladuta, or the “Messenger from the Waters.” Srila Prabhupada traveled with only an umbrella, a suitcase, forty rupees (which he could not change into dollars), and his most treasured possession, which he would read during the voyage, Sri Caitanya-caritamrta.        

August 21, 1965, the Jaladuta arrived in Cochin, South India. The trunks containing Srila Prabhupada’s two hundred three-volume sets of Srimad Bhagavatam, which had been shipped from Calcutta, were loaded on board and stored in the hold of the Jaladuta. After many years of Srila Prabhupada’s painstaking labor, the goddess of devotion, Bhakti Devi, was now transported from Vrindavan to the U.S. She was tucked safely within the pages of Srimad Bhagavatam as the many volumes rested in the small, dark hold of the weather-beaten cargo ship. 

The Jaladuta now served as a literary temple enshrining Bhakti Devi and the Srimad Bhagavatam, the literary incarnation of the Supreme Lord, as it carried them to the West. This was Srila Prabhupada’s loving offering at the lotus feet of his spiritual master and the previous acharyas. One volume of this original Bhagavatam is now enshrined in the Palace of Gold, Srila Prabhupada’s samadhi.

In a lecture on August 18, 1968, Srila Prabhupada said, “So we should associate by the vibration, and not by the physical presence. That is real association.” When the acharyas depart from this mortal realm, they leave behind their spiritual vibration in their books. Krsna Himself maintains the spiritual purity of these books. All those who follow in the footsteps of the great souls will experience a tangible connection and an everlasting relationship with the acaryas.
