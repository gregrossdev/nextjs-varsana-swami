Srila Prabhupada has given us a unique opportunity by bringing Krishna Consciousness to the West. Engaging in bhakti-yoga is an honor and privilege we must all appreciate. The roots of the Bhakti movement originate in a personality named Bhakti Devi. So understanding our beginnings is an appropriate place to start.

Bhakti Devi is the personification of devotion and the goddess of Vrindavan. She once revealed the details of her figurative birth and life to the great sage Narada Muni. Her story, as told in the Bhagavat Mahatmya (Padma Purana), reveals the historical development of the bhakti movement in India and predicts her voyage to the rest of the world.   

Once while visiting Vrindavan, Narada Muni saw an amazing sight. On the banks of the Yamuna sat a beautiful young girl. Next to her lay two very old, feeble men whom she tried to console while weeping piteously. When Narada approached her, she gratefully greeted him, saying, "By meeting a sadhu like you, I think some good fortune has come to me."

Narada Muni inquired about her situation, and the beautiful girl related her story: "I am known as Bhakti Devi. These two older men are my sons, Jnana (knowledge) and Vairagya (renunciation). But, why, you must wonder, are they so old while I remain young? I will tell you my woeful tale.

"O sage, I was born in Dravidadesh in south India. I grew up in Karnataka, reaching my maturity there. Then I lived in Maharastra where I was respected. From Maharastra I moved to Gujarat, where I became old. Kali reigns in Gujarat, which had become the residence of many demoniac persons. Here I was forced to live a long time and was mistreated, thus becoming weak and diminished. 

"My sons also suffered, becoming old and morose, losing all vitality. We later entered Vrindavan, where I was miraculously rejuvenated and endowed with enviable beauty. Yet, my sons are still aging and are in agony due to exhaustion. I don't know what is causing this, but I sense that I will leave Vrindavan and go abroad in the future."

Narada Muni had tried to revive Jnana and Vairagya by reciting Vedic scriptures, like the Gita, Upanishads, the Gayatri, and other mantras, into their ears. They would wake momentarily but would soon relapse into unconsciousness. Narada assured Bhakti Devi that he would search for a solution and then departed, making his way to Bhadarikasrama, where he met the four Kumaras.

The Kumaras advised Narada Muni that the only way Jnana and Vairagya could recover was by hearing Bhagavatam. They praised the Srimad Bhagavatam, citing its supremacy and potency as the topmost scripture. The benefits of hearing bhagavat-katha know no bounds and its glories are unsurpassed. They convinced Narada Muni to arrange for a great discourse on Bhagavatam to take place on the bank of the Ganges in Haridwar, to be attended by scores of great sages.

Because the Bhagavatam was so highly lauded, Bhakti Devi immediately appeared on the scene with her two sons, now vigorous and youthful, and all chanting - krsna govinda hare murare madhu kaitavare. She bowed to the four Kumaras and addressed Sanat Kumar, "In this Kali-yuga my limbs were crippled, but hearing the wonders of Srimad-Bhagavatam from your mouth nourished me, and my beautiful, youthful body has returned. My two sons have also become as young as before. But where shall I stay now?"

The Kumaras replied, "You are Bhakti Devi. You maintain and care for the bhaktas, the dear devotees of Lord Hari, so they can achieve krsna-prema. Therefore, always reside in the hearts of the Vaishnavas. That is your place."

As we trace the parallel between the movements of Bhakti Devi and the history of the bhakti cult of India, we find that her health and growth thrived due to her association with notable saints. Her birth in Dravidadesh was where the Alvars (Tamil poet-saints immersed in God) renewed the culture of bhakti through their songs of longing, ecstasy, and service.

After her birth, Bhakti Devi spent her early years in the state of Tamil Nadu where Ramanuja Acarya, (who was understood to be an incarnation of Laksmana) contributed a systematic philosophy articulating the science of devotional service.

In the 12th century, Bhakti developed her youthful form in Karnataka due to the efforts of Madvacharya, an incarnation of Hanuman. Bhakti-devi spent adolescence (between the 14th and 16th centuries) in Maharastra and adjoining provinces with the assistance of the local saints. She reached her maturity after returning to Vrindavan in the 16th century, where Lord Chaitanya and the six Goswamis offered theological, philosophical, logical, and intellectual methodology supporting the legitimacy of her spontaneous emotional nature. 

Srimati Bhakti-devi, a goddess of Vrindavan, outlined her plans of traveling worldwide: idam sthanam parityajya videsam gamyate maya, "Leaving this place, I will go abroad."

This prophecy of Bhakti Devi to go abroad coincided with Lord Chaitanya's own predictions.

prthivi paryanta yata ache desa grama, 

sarvatra sancara haibeka mora nama

"In every town and village of the world, the chanting of My name will be heard." (Chaitanya-bhagavata, Antya 4.126)

ebe nama sankirtana tiksna khadga lana

antara asura jivera pheliba katiya

yadi papi chadi dharma dura dese yaya

mora senapati-bhakta yaibe tathaya

"Taking the sharp sword of the congregational chanting of the Holy Name, I will root out and destroy the demoniac mentality in the hearts of the conditioned souls. If some sinful people escape and, giving up religious principles, go to far-off countries, then My commander-in-chief (senapati bhakta) will appear to chase after them and distribute Krishna consciousness." (Caitanya- mangala)

As Lord Chaitanya foretold, "taking up the sharp sword of chanting" to create a drastic transformation in personal and global consciousness is no small feat. 

The Srimad Bhagavatam exalts those who follow this path: "O great sage, amongst many millions who are liberated and perfect in knowledge of liberation, one may be a devotee of Lord Narayana, or Krishna. Such devotees, who are fully peaceful, are extremely rare." (SB:6.15.5)

Among thousands, a few rare souls may attain liberation from material bondage (mukti) by various spiritual techniques, but pure devotion submits to no strategies. Unadulterated bhakti honors only the purity of heart, the humility of spirit, and the commitment of purpose personified in authentic and simple sadhus. Srila Prabhupada, one such soul, demonstrated these principles to such a degree that Krishna accompanied and empowered him because Bhakti is inseparable from Krishna and His pure devotees. She came to the West with Srila Prabhupada in the form of Srimad Bhagavatam, carried in the hold of Jaladuta.
