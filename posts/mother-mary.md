In Luke 1:26 – 38, the angel Gabriel comes to Mary of Nazareth and prophesizes that she will become pregnant, give birth to a son, and name him Jesus. She asked how this was possible when she was a virgin, and Gabriel informed her that the Holy Spirit would come to her and thus her child would be known as the son of God. Mary answered, surrendering to the Lord's will, "I am the Lord's servant. Let everything you've said happen to me." 

When Mary became pregnant at about 13 years of age, out of wedlock, it was assumed that she must have engaged in an illicit romance even while betrothed to the highly virtuous and devout soul named Joseph. After all, Nazareth was known as a place where Roman soldiers would go to indulge in exploiting the local girls.

For this imagined offense, Mary faced death by stoning, a most painful and humiliating technique. Yet even while subjected to the epitome of misunderstanding, confusion, shame, and disgrace, Mother Mary remained faithful and confident in the assurance of the archangel's words even though she could not yet understand their import.

Although Mary pleaded to Joseph that the Holy Spirit conceived the child, Joseph was unconvinced and wanted to leave her. Then the archangel Gabriel appeared to Joseph and corroborated Mary's story. From that point on, Joseph claimed responsibility for the pregnancy, reducing Mary's sentence from capital punishment to a social outcast.

Mary of Nazareth's ordeal took place over 2,000 years ago. So what does it have to do with us today?

These events are relevant because Krishna tests all of His devotees – each and every one. However brutal, unfair, and bewildering our circumstances may appear from the point of reference we commonly use (either self or myself,) it all emerges and culminates in a perfect plan as seen through the eyes of God.

Mary's pleading with Joseph demonstrates the proper intention to avoid unnecessary pain, along with the determination to endure the challenges that are truly unavoidable and meaningful components of fulfilling our calling by God. Therefore, while striving to improve our circumstances, the wise do not overly blame the other players in the game, knowing that nothing can occur without the sanction of God. And though He may not desire certain injustices and catastrophes, He nonetheless allows them for the ultimate benefit. The ultimate benefit is that His prodigal children, after going through a purification process, turn back to Him. In due course, they graduate from the school of life and return home to the loving embrace of Sri Krishna's most affectionate servants.

As Jesus was being crucified, the Blessed Virgin stood at the foot of the cross at Calvary. Mary's suffering at that time was so intense that she nearly died with her tormented son. Although other disciples and followers had fled into hiding, abandoning their master out of fear for their own lives, Mary Magdalen and the Apostle John stood firm with her. Seeing his mother with the disciple he loved standing beside her, Jesus said, referring to John, "Woman, here is your son." Then, motioning towards Mary, Jesus said to John, "Here is your mother." From that time on, John took Mary into his home and protected her as he would a mother.

In time, that portion of the world's population who came to know Mary of Nazareth transferred their worship of the earth goddess onto her. Thus she offers a personal and gentle face to the vast material, i.e., maternal energy. And Mary comforts her children in their fear of a vague, remote God who is all-powerful, all-pervading, all-knowing, unapproachable, authoritarian, and frightening. As a result, many Christians have come to hold a special place in their hearts for Mother Mary, who is gentle, approachable, and believable.

Although the Virgin Mary's theological role has been an item of contention between Protestants and Catholics since the Middle Ages, both sides of the theological divide continue to view this simple and pious village maiden as an inspiring and beloved figure. The Catholic Church remains fixed in veneration of her, as testified by a host of expressions. 

The Rosary, specifically devoted to Mary, mirrors the Gaudiya Vaisnava practice of chanting japa in glorifying the Divine Couple.

"Regarding the Christian's Trinity, I believe it is called God, the Holy Ghost, and the son. A person in Krishna Consciousness accepts this by the name Visnu, Paramatma, and Jiva. God is a Person, the holy spirit or the Supersoul is a person, and the living entity is also a person. Also, Mary is the representation of the energy of God. Either as internal energy Radharani or as external energy Durga, the energy of Godhead can be considered the mother of the living entities. " (Prabhupada letter to Sivananda, 19th April 1968)
