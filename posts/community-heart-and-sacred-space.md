Our experience of Krishna and taste for devotional service is proportional to the quality of our relationships. The Lord is irresistibly drawn to loving dealings between devotees. Thus, everyone yearns for a community where loving relationships flourish, for such is our true home.

The word “love” was loosely used in the early 60’s and excessively commercialized since then, and has gradually lost its dignity, meaning and potential. The word “heart”, which meant to indicate the abode and receptacle of love, has suffered as well. Considered as the seat of emotion in the West, traditional cultures honor the heart as the realm of intuition and intellect, because our most worthy thoughts emerge not from the head, but from a deeper realm - _the heart._

Symbolic of the central point of mortal life, where blood is dispensed to the entire body and returns thereafter, the heart is emblematic of the inner presence of God and His kingdom, along with the _jiva_ and his awareness.

The heart acts as the first part of the body to indicate life symptoms, and the sign of death when it stops beating. It indicates a standard of commitment expressed as “with one's whole heart”, referring to relationships which endure till one's dying breath and even beyond.

Furthermore the heart conveys a secret and confidential realm where spirit is infused into matter. Amidst friends, guides, and all who give counsel, opening the heart is the means to access that sacred space where the Lord serves as counselor, interacting in the lives of those who come together to discern His will and movements.

Sacred space, where trust and confidentiality prevails, touch the heart deeply, dispelling sorrow, fear, and discouragement. Such exchanges are therapeutic and illuminating; for pain shared is pain redeemed

Loving interactions for the sake of Krishna's satisfaction are so pleasing to Him that He allows His mercy and loving kindness to become a tangible reality in our life and consciousness. Ultimately, it is Krishna's love which is healing, inspiring, and redemptive, yet we can access that very love through the love shared with each other.

As we encourage one another to cultivate awareness and to fearlessly follow the dictates of the spirit, the confidential space we call the “heart” expands to make room for true communion, from which loving relationships can be restored and community revived.
