Dear Srila Prabhupada,

Please accept my humble obeisances. All glories to your divine lotus feet.

Early on in your movement, even in your presence, we barely understood your glories as the Founder-Acharya of ISKCON, the incarnation of Lord Nityananda's mercy, and the ambassador of Goloka Vrindavana. Yet we were deeply confident of your love, and thus we trusted your guidance. We developed a favorable impression of the Supreme Father due to the loving manner in which you represented Him.

Arriving in the United States, you found a generation of lost souls. Our well-meaning parents strove to provide better for us materially, but still we were not happy. There was an insurmountable chasm, making it impossible for us to relate to them, our teachers, our government, and even our religion. We were convinced society needed to be reinvented, that something critical was missing. Intuitively, we knew that vacancy was spiritual in nature.

I, like many of my peers, felt myself a spiritual orphan. Even though my parents offered a stable, loving home and nurtured us to the best of their capacity, spiritually and materially, it was not sufficient.

I longed for a spiritual father who would walk patiently with me, empathize with me, and consistently point me in the direction of God. You became that perfect father. Recognizing this, some parents -like my own, who had initially felt hurt that they could not provide what I needed -gradually came to appreciate you for filling that void. Achieving your protection saved us from seeking fulfillment elsewhere. For the pioneers of ISKCON, seeking your approval became foremost in our lives, rescuing us from the danger of seeking applause and acceptance from the temporal world.

With a deep sense of gratitude, indebtedness, and longing to reciprocate your infinite kindness, construction began on a living space for you in New Vrindavan. We hoped you would be able to finish your translation and commentary on Srimad-Bhagavatam uninterrupted. As the modest country retreat we had planned for you has transformed into the yoga-pitha of your Palace of Gold, memories and testimonials of your presence have become enshrined within its walls. Here, the spiritual and material worlds overlap, inviting pilgrims to enter more deeply into a relationship with you. Amongst the cherished items in that treasury of remembrances, your visit to the Palace in 1974 and the revelation you shared with us then holds a place of great prominence.

While you circumambulated the portico path, you halted repeatedly to tap your cane on the solid walls, indicating where you desired windows to be installed. You insisted on “natural lighting, not artificial.”

When our parikrama halted at the portal to the inner chamber (now the temple room) we members of the palace construction team wondered whether you would request this room to have natural lighting as well -a potentially complicated operation that would pose significant challenges. As you glanced throughout the room, Bali Mardana (who was visiting for the occasion) articulated what the construction crew had been contemplating. Speaking on our behalf, he said, “This room will be illumined by jewels in the columns, just like Krsna's palaces in Dwarka.”

Your gaze turned from the unfinished concrete columns to the devotees standing amongst them. Sweeping your cane upward in an arch which encompassed all of the devotees present, you offered us a glimpse into the perception of an uttama-adhikari by responding with utmost humility, “These devotees are my jewels.”

Your words are sacramental, empowered to create what they convey. In your presence, the devotees became effulgent by reflecting the various hues of your blessing. Seeing the devotees become bright-faced, you beamed, thus revealing the most natural illumination of all. We, your “jewels”, beamed back, inviting you to begin the process of polishing us to fully uncover the spiritual luster you saw within all of us.

We had never seen each other that way—as jewels. You were the first to value us for something worthy and inherently spiritual, and in turn we were able to truly value one another. Standing shoulder-to-shoulder, we experienced unprecedented affection, appreciation, and respect for one other.

Srila Prabhupada, you are the cintamani jewel, the touchstone who fulfills all desires, transforming and enriching the nature of those who accept Your Divine Grace. The reciprocal relationship between the crest jewel and its surrounding gems is ever-increasing. The brilliance of this loving exchange, enshrined within my heart, dispels the darkness and gloom of this material world.

Greater than a touchstone which produces only what its owner desires, you reveal the life and love of Vrindavana to those of us who had neither the understanding that such a wonder existed, any conscious desire to attain it, nor even the capacity to comprehend its significance.

Following that memorable occasion, I took up residence in the unfinished servants' quarters in the Palace in order to serve as night guard. In the early morning hours, my japa was enriched by the feeling of your enduring presence. I began conducting mangala-aratik to a picture placed in the space that became your altar.

Today, forty-two years later, I continue attending mangala-aratik at your Palace. Your jewels are found there every morning. On some evenings, devotees congregate in the inner chamber to share remembrances and appreciations of you and your followers. Even recollections of those who are no longer with us continue to reflect your effulgence and contribute their part to the stock of luminous jewels that have accumulated over the years -the natural lighting you requested. As we grow older, we reflect on those memories with deeper fondness and richer gratitude. In this way our devotional lives are continually enriched.

After attending mangala-arati at your smrti-samadhi, I return to the shelter of New Vrindavan's Govardhan Hill. Gazing back toward the Palace, the rising sun offers a dazzling backdrop. The illumination from within the Palace filters through the ornate patterns of stained glass windows, revealing a treasure chest overflowing with gems of every variety and color.

The luster of this scene rescues us from the lies we had believed and the truths we had denied, setting us free to celebrate life with those we love as your worthy representatives. In that celebration, you infuse all we say and do with a joy which neither ignores nor denies our residual fears, but rather integrates them with a growing love which dispels all misgivings. This gives us hope that you will bring us home before darkness engulfs the world at the twilight of the Golden Age.

Srila Prabhupada, may all generations come to know you as their loving spiritual father lest your institution become a machine that loses its sense of confidence born of family support and relationships. Grant that we may forever come together in sankirtan, the only place where there is true unity, harmony, sanctity, and strength in the single conception that we are a family of servants, striving to enthuse and bring joy to one another for Krsna's pleasure and deepen our commitment to the chanting of the holy name.

Krsna reveals your glories, Srila Prabhupada, through the illumined hearts of those who love you. As your jewels serve you in spreading the holy name to every town and village, their preaching is effective in as much as they individually reflect your effulgence, devotion, and humility through their dedication. As the priceless jewel of service in separation, that treasure which you have so graciously bequeathed to us, grows ever-brighter and sheds light on the path back to home, back to you. Please bless us to retain that radiance that you saw in us. Thus your legacy will forevermore endure and expand.

Your servant,

Varsana Swami
