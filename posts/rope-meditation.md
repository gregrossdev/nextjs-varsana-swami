Like a vast tapestry of beautiful and colorful lilas, the month of Kartik excels as the sweetest and most charming time in Vraja. Kartik, also known as Damodara, is the king of months and the favorite of Sri Krishna. The name “Kartik” is derived from “Kartiki,” a name that honors Srimati Radharani as the daughter of Kirtiki, another name of Kirtida.

The sweetness of this glorious month is increased due to the influence of His Queen, Kartiki. It was Her,  Sri Radha, who first bound Sri Krishna with her delicate, silken sash. This pastime symbolizes and glorifies the image of the Lord as the original thread that attracts, unites, and weaves everyone and everything together.

During Kartik, we generally practice additional forms of sadhana. Twice a day, devotees gather to light candles and offer them to the Damodar form of Krishna. These meaningful offerings kindle the flame of our love, while the singing of “Damodarastakam” awakens the sweetest flavor of tender affection toward our childlike Lord.

In the diary of his spiritual journey (“Damodarastakam” prayer), Satyavrata Muni begins with effusive praise of the Supreme as the form of sat-cit-ananda and culminates with the worship of a rope. Finally, he condenses the glories of Kartik into one last verse, conveying its essence: “O Lord, the entire universe was created by Lord Brahma, who was born from Your abdomen, who then was bound with a rope by Mother Yasoda. To this rope, I offer my humble obeisances.”

Let us look at Satyavrata Muni’s sentiments of honoring a rope. Symbolic strings, cords, and knots are prevalent in many cultures that incorporate them into their rituals and ceremonies. The rope, in general, and the specifics of how it is cast, knotted, or looped, represent subtle and mystical propensities.

The rope symbolizes the desire for and means of ascension, the connection between the spiritual and material worlds. The binding thread enacts the union of the individual soul and Krishna. While worldly ropes bind the jivas in suffering and limitation, the strings of spiritual love offer hope and means of deliverance and freedom. The marriage of bride and groom, similar to the connection between the jiva and Isvara, is denoted by interweaving two threads into a single string, signifying two individual lives unifying into one spirit.

A rope consists of interwoven threads, each signifying an agent who links all beings in relationship to one another and back to their original cause. Furthermore, the string, or sutra, connects this reflected material world to the spiritual reality it mirrors. A tapestry is created by individual threads, rhythmically woven back and forth across a loom. Similarly, the rhythms of life and death, inhalation and exhalation, light and darkness, cause and effect, evolution and involution, flow regularly, weaving the intricate pattern of life. The concept of extraordinary potencies lurking within the image of a rope finds its origin in the pastimes of Radha and Krishna enacted during Kartik.

In vatsalya bhava, the rope is in Mother Yasoda’s hands, binding her son to a mortar. Finding Krishna to be naughty and wanting to discipline Him; she ties Him with ropes of motherly love. Similarly, the cows of Vrindavan, who also have maternal sentiments toward Krishna, bind Damodara with the same ropes which tie them at the time of milking.

The effects of Kartik’s rope are mutual. As the rope pulls the devotee toward Krishna, it also draws Krishna into the temple of His devotees’ hearts. The Lord is bound by their love and cannot escape; their devotion renders Him captive. The same ropes which bind Krishna also serve to deliver others. Krishna feels indebted to devotees who bind Him with their love, and He seeks the means of clearing his debt.

Krishna’s quality of allowing to be bound by a rope, a most astonishing attribute of His, is not seen as a fault but rather an ornament that delights His devotees.

Prominent amongst the bitter-sweet lilas is Srila Prabhupada’s final pastime. As Damodara’s loyal servant,  he wove strong ropes of attachment that bound his disciples to him with love. Later, these ropes pulled the devotees across all obstacles of resistance, reluctance, impersonalism, and even the disruption created by apparent death and separation.

Krishna carries His rope in various ways and in different manners, which signifies the range of effects His rope possesses. When Krishna sets forth with his coil of rope slung loosely over His shoulder, the devotees feel joyful, knowing He is searching for lost souls. They wish him all success in drawing the reclaimed soul back into the intricate network of His pastimes. When draped up high upon His turban, the same rope serves as the banner proclaiming His victory in retrieving the heart of that fortunate soul He was pursuing.

Lost souls can bind Krishna simply by their willingness to open their hearts to Him. This participation on their part casts the thread that unites them with Krishna, Who, in turn, does not fail to reciprocate. This same thread grows stronger as the reciprocation flows back and forth and ripens into the rope Krishna uses to lead the fortunate soul back home.

Remaining forever bound by that first tie of affection, Radha and Krsna invite us all to weave the fabric of our individual lives into the transcendental tapestry of Braja. Thus, the tapestry depicting the most splendid and luminous lilas will be expanded and embellished, decorating Vraja, enlivening the devotees, and delighting their Lordships in the month of Kartik.
