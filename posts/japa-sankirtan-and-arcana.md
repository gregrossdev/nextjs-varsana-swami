Japa and kirtan are two applications of the Holy Name. Japa is an introspective journey into our being with the aim to purify our hearts and find the Lord within. Furthermore, it is meant to ground us in our connection with the Lord, and it is only from that place that we can truly reach out to others. Japa is essential and foundational, yet preliminary.

Japa culminates in sankirtana, a collective glorification of the Lord, which involves chanting and serving together while engaging in respectful, loving, and inspiring interactions. Sankirtan integrates our relationship with Krishna and our relationships with everyone and everything around us, including nature and Mother Earth. 

Every living entity is a unique expression of Krishna's wonder and has a relationship with Krishna based on that truth. Therefore, the most complete experience of Krishna is in the environment where all beings interact and share their unique aspects of Krishna. And that is Braja, that is sankirtan.

 Through the different processes of devotional service, we solidify and expand our connection and understanding of Krishna. Deity worship aims to perceive Krishna in the heart of every living entity. The objective of japa is to meet the Lord in our hearts. And the perfection of sankirtan is to perceive Vrindavana, the heartland of Krishna.
