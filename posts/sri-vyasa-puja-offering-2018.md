Dear Srila Prabhupada,

Please accept my humble obeisances! All glories to Your Divine Grace and sacred mission!

_Among the host of your guru's disciples_

_You alone fulfilled the order_

_To carry his message, more brilliant than the sun,_ 

_To dissipate darkness on western shores._

_Through storms that swept the ocean_

_You brought tidings from afar_

_To proclaim that night was ending_ 

_Like the early morning star._

_Seemingly alone . . . impoverished_

_You arrived within our midst_

_Giving to all . . . looking for one Who might understand_

_The treasure of divine love Overflowing from your heart._

_You found a generation born of wealth_ 

_Who nothing of this world could satisfy_ 

_Children lost . . . unfulfilled_ 

_Our hearts starving . . . dry . . . suppressed._

_Drawn to follow you_

_Leaving all else behind We found spiritual fulfilment_ 

_And our hearts were satisfied._

_Bhakti became our daily bread_

_Rasa quenched our deepest thirst_ 

_And in Krsna's holy name_ 

_We found life's very breath._

_What followed would be unbelievable_

_Other than the fact that it is true_

_The prophesized Golden Age_

_Dawning in your words, before our very eyes._

_As you sang praise of Lord Gauranga_

_And chanted Krsna's name_

_Sleeping souls arose to the light of truth_ 

_Finding new hope in the dawning day._

_Suddha-nama descended_

_To dance upon your lips_ 

_Resonating in our hearts_ 

_Awakening our love._

_You sang of your beautiful homeland_ 

_Surrendered souls' most treasured goal_ 

_Where there is neither birth nor death_ 

_Though years of eternity roll._

_Successive chapters have opened_

_As previous ones have closed_

_Twilight has come and darkness ensues_ 

_Shades of night cast shadowy hues_

_The messenger of the waters_

_Is with us no more_

_Jaladuta's last voyage sailed Back to her eastern shore._

_Yet you still hold the helm_

_And continue to chart the course_

_Guiding the way_

_To our final destination._

_With the music of your homeland_ 

_Resounding in our ears_

_Our hearts are drawn to join you there_ 

_Beyond the veil of tears._

_The way you lead us now_

_Is deeper than before._

_For communion speaks through separation_

_Cleansing comes through tears._

_By hearing we can see_

_You are closer to us_

_Than we are to ourselves_

_In the loving embrace of your vani._

_The treasure of our inheritance awaits_

_In the literary temple you created_

_Admittance to the inner sanctum granted_

_To those who serve your mission._

_The lotus feet of Lord Gauranga_

_Are there enshrined_

_Leading beyond majestic Vaikuntha_ 

_To that charming land, Cintamani-dham._

_The enchanting pastoral realm_

_Where the sweetness of Krsna's love abounds_

_Eclipsing the notion that He is God_ 

_Proclaiming that bhakti reigns supreme._

_From there, your eternal residence, so far away from here_ 

_We hear your voice calling ever so clear_

_Even though I lag behind, bound to mortal frame_

_In your words I find my guide, my life, my home -everything to sustain._

_It is with this assurance_

_That we celebrate this day_

_When you blessed the earth_

_By your glorious birth._

_On this most sacred occasion_

_Please enrich our remembrance of the love we found in you_ 

_Who remains our faithful companion_

_In times of joy as well as tears._

_Unite us in the memories Growing fonder every day_ 

_Bestow the faith and patience_

_To nurture us all the way._

_Bless our attempts to follow your footprints_

_In word and deed as well_

_To harmonize through endless praise_

_Every heartbeat, moment, breath and day._

_May the Divine Grace of Srila Vyasadeva_

_Who descended with your appearance_ 

_Continue to sing in your living words_

_To breathe new and eternal life_

_Into the hearts of all the world._

Your dasa anu dasa, 

Varsana Swami
