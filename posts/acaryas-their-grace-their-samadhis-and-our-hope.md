Living in this material world from time immemorial imparts formidable conditionings. With assistance from _maya_, we have successfully built a wall around ourselves, excluding God and others from our internal lives. We have become incarcerated by our own limitations and paralyzed by our own fears to such an extent that we cannot free ourselves. The nature of the false ego keeps us individually and collectively imprisoned in our self centered world. The shackles of desires to exploit, enjoy, control, and be respected are stronger than any iron chains.

Our conditioning is like the impenetrable wall of a dungeon from which all hope of escape is lost. Our only hope is in calling upon the pure devotees of the Lord, _mahatmas_, who are already free and who reside outside the prison house. The grace they bestow dissolves the formidable walls of illusion, which separate us from the light and love of reality.

The lives of the _mahatmas_ are enriched with devotion, humility, and compassion. We should revere their lives and immerse ourselves in their teachings and their mercy. We serve them and beg for their blessings, because it is only by their grace, protection and guidance, that we can be led out of the bewildering labyrinths of material existence.

Krishna cannot resist the heart-rending prayers of His pure devotees, and when we are favored by them, He takes charge of our lives by activating and orchestrating everything in creation to help bring us home.

The _mahatmas_ come to this world to fulfill the will of the Lord, to uplift us and to place us on a higher level and within the larger picture. These great souls broaden our perception and shift our focus to perceive a realm of opportunities emerging from what seems to be a world made of obstacles. That which looked so oppressive before becomes liberating simply by their enlightening distribution of Radha and Krishna's inherent grace.

We call for help to both great devotees who live among us and those who have departed. The departed _acaryas_ are not frozen in time; their mercy is still attainable and especially accessible on the auspicious days of their appearance or disappearance, because of the sanctity which accompanies these occasions. Such days offer special opportunities to remember the mahatmas, to pray to them, and to glorify their transcendental qualities. This evokes their satisfaction and they reciprocate by bestowing blessings.

Furthermore, the acaryas extend their mercy by their presence in _samadhis_ which are imbued with the divine energy that washes away _anarthas_ and brings light into our hearts. As our appreciation for their qualities, sacrifices and selfless service becomes enriched and our fortitude to sincerely follow in their footsteps strengthens, the opportunity to receive the blessing of their eternal association opens.
