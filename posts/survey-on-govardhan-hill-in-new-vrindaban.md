title: Survey on Govardhan Hill in New Vrindaban

Today there was a survey on Govardhan Hill. It began behind the big Gaura Nitai murtis. The surveyor's helper, a teenage boy, asked, "What are these statues?" I introduced them to the personality of Lord Caitanya, after which he asked, "Why are there two forms for one God?" At this point, the conversation became more spiritual. I was impressed by the boy's humility, sincerity, and simplicity. We felt a mutual connection.

When they reached the threshold of Govardhan, they started establishing reference points to mark the boundaries. First, they set an iron stake in the ground next to Radha Kunda to set a benchmark. Then, they started to look for additional reference points to form a grid. Everywhere they looked they saw landscape features that did not appear to be of this world.

They looked at Kundesvara Mahadeva, Lalita Kunda, Asta-sakhis gazebo, and the original Radha Gopinath stone altar. They were mesmerized. They seemed to be sensing that this is not a typical piece of property that can be measured by empirical means.

Then the crew leader turned to me and asked, "Where am I? What is this hill I am about to survey? What is the significance of this temple you are building, and what is this pond on the top of the hill?"

"You are in the heart of Vrindavan," I replied and then explained, in a nutshell, the significance of Govardhan Hill and Vrindavan -- of which this is a replica. Then, after a moment of reflection, he said, "I have been around New Vrindavan before, but this region is distinct within the community." Then, he took a little pause and added, "I should watch my step and be more respectful, not just trampling around here as if this is some ordinary piece of land or mistakenly thinking that I know where I am, what to speak of establishing boundaries and property lines."

The magic of the Dhama served us well today.
