The flowery words of the Vedas encourage their followers to ascend to heaven, or even Vaikuntha, by enticing them with descriptions of the most enjoyable path. The path seems to be paved with flower petals, lined with fragrant foliage, leading through friendly regions of angelic beings who assist the pilgrim's journey.

Ascending is always demanding, more so in attaining Vaikuntha than simply achieving a heavenly planet. And the path to Vraja, the highest paradise, the abode of the Lord's most confidential pastimes, is the most challenging journey of all. On account of its confidentiality, Vraja Dhama is carefully protected and warrants strict criteria for entry. In Vaikuntha, there is standard spiritual protocol versus the exceptional confidentiality of Vraja, which requires the most exalted state of purity for participation. 

On the path to Vraja, the aspirant will most likely encounter the most merciless treatment, significant misunderstandings, and vicious accusations by former friends and family, culture and society, and the mind and body. Those who previously encouraged us on the road to illusion will reject, condemn, or intimidate us as they witness our resolve to dedicate our life and soul to Krishna alone.

The well-spring of life-giving mellows, which grants everlasting satisfaction and fulfillment to the soul, is surrounded and protected by insurmountable obstacles to test our mettle. Do we have the needed character, patience, and perseverance? Purity and humility are necessary to attract the mercy of the Lord, which is our only shelter. His mercy, in granting empowerment, enables even lame pilgrims to cross over the Himalayas, dumb men to recite eloquent poetry, and the blind to see the brilliance of the stars.  

If the aspirant succumbs to despair, he backslides into the depths of utter discouragement. His faith will then flicker, questioning whether the Lord even truly loves us. At this stage, the devotee might even doubt himself, as well as his true friends and spiritual well-wishers. 

The numerous chronicles of those who have gone before us reveal how we should aspire to value difficulties, trials, and tribulations. They are, in reality, the arrangements made by so many kind-hearted well-wishers, inspired by the infinite wisdom of the all-merciful Lord. He works in and through all things to evoke the spiritual potential leading to the highest attainment. This He does for those who love Him truly and are called to His service. 

The greatest inspirational accounts of facing challenges and remaining fixed can be found within the Lilamrita of Srila Prabhupada. May his pastimes and precepts resonate in our hearts, providing inspiration and faith in accepting challenges with humble gratitude and unalloyed trust on this most demanding path to Vraja.
