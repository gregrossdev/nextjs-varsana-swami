Adi Guru's blessings are essential for the spiritual processes, from inception through fruition. The potency of Lord Baladeva, the Original Guru, arises in the heart, which is softened by humility, gentleness, kindness, and servitude.

The representatives of Baladeva in the line of guru Parampara humbly offer the service of uprooting anarthas in the hearts of their followers. This is the principal duty of the guru and the function of Lord Baladeva's plow – to turn over and under the weeds in the hearts of aspiring devotees. This creates a fresh, clean seedbed within a soft and fertile field where the guru places the seed of devotion. Aware that anarthas may infiltrate the heart through undesirable association, the guru trains the disciple to remain vigilant in identifying and uprooting those creepers which imitate and compete with the bhakti-lata-bija.  

In his Krishna Samhita, Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura inaugurated a trend that the acharyas have followed - deciphering what anarthas the demons in Krishna Lila represent. He writes that some anarthas should be destroyed by a person's own endeavor and purity and some by the mercy of Krishna. Those undesirables, overcome by our own endeavors, are related to the demons killed by Lord Baladeva.  

Devotees know that we are powerless to overcome our own anarthas, so what is it that Srila Bhaktivinoda implies? He is inferring that when we understand and experience how our own anarthas are unfavorable to the cultivation of nama-bhajan, we naturally become humble. Thakurji is educating us regarding our responsibility to cultivate such a deep spirit of humility that Krishna will respond with mercy by awakening the mood of Balarama in our hearts. Balaji thus appears in our hearts to kill those demons which Krishna delegates to His elder brother. 

The precise details regarding the relationship between Krishna and Balarama as They assist Their devotees along the path of anartha-nivritti are complex and somewhat mysterious. It is a science that must be learned through the words, personal example, and association of Sri Guru.  

What is the significance of the demons that Krishna reserves in preference for that they are liberated by Baladeva? 

Dhenukasura

Dhenukasura is a donkey, a beast of burden--a common term used by the washermen, referring to carrying heavy loads of dirty laundry. This represents the nature of the conditioned soul who accumulates and carries the heavy burden of dishonesty, deceit, forgetfulness of our constitutional position, lust, anger, greed, pride, illusion, and envy. We are carrying this load within our hearts, making the upward path of sadhana bhakti very burdensome and the proper darshan and parikrama of Vraja Dhama impossible. 

Dhenukasura represents the conditioned soul who utilizes the senses, mind, intellect, and all his resources to pursue mundane relationships based on the flesh, which means opposed to the spirit. Thus, he considers the material world as the goal of fulfillment and satisfaction without considering that life has much more meaning and significance than this.

Pralambasura 

Although the lila of Lord Balarama killing Pralambasura has not been commented upon in so much detail, Srila Bhaktivinoda Thakura has given us a proper understanding in seed form. 

Amongst the demons killed by Balarama, Pralambasura is one of the most significant. Pralambasura manifests in the consciousness of the conditioned devotee on the gross and subtle levels. On the gross level, he manifests as lustful ambition. On a subtle level, he manifests as the desire for profit, adoration, and distinction. Even more subtly, Pralambasura manifests as attempts to increase one's sense of honor and false prestige, including a desire for a particular social position, image, and worshipful attention of others. 

Subtler still, Pralambasura is the Mayavada influence of the thief in disguise, who strives to steal oneself from himself by advocating the merging with impersonal Brahman. Thereby depriving the jiva of bliss and Krishna of the joy of celebrating his lost jiva returning back home.  

In another example, Pralambasura feared Krishna, having heard of His power. Not understanding Balarama's position; however, Pralambasura hoped He would be less powerful. "Perhaps I can defeat Him," he thought. In this case, Pralambasura represents extreme impersonalism which targets the guru and minimizes his status. This lila offers a graphic demonstration of the havoc which ensues when Mayavadi influence infiltrates a Vaisnava community. Mayavadis target the functional position of Gurudeva to minimize his role so that impersonalism may prevail. It also illustrates how Baladeva personally intervenes as a protective guardian when the sanctity of guru-tattva and the spiritual welfare of devotees is in jeopardy.

This extreme impersonalism is illustrated in CC Antya-lila 6.43 – 51 in "The Meeting of Sri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and Raghunath das Goswami." 

In the village of Panihati, Raghunath Das obtained a darshan of Lord Nityananda, who was accompanied by many kirtan performers, servants, and others. Sitting on a rock under a tree on the bank of the Ganges, Lord Nityananda seemed as effulgent as hundreds of thousands of rising suns. Many devotees sat on the ground surrounding Him. Seeing His effulgence and influence, Raghunath Das was astonished. He offered his obeisances by falling prostrate at a distant place, and the servant of Nityananda Prabhu pointed out, "There is Raghunath Das, offering You obeisances."  Hearing this, Lord Nityananda said, "You are a thief. Now you have come to see Me? Come here, come here. Today I shall punish you!"  The Lord called for him, but Raghunath Das did not go near the Lord. Then the Lord forcibly caught him and placed His lotus feet upon Raghunath Dasa's head. Lord Nityananda was very merciful and funny. Being compassionate, He spoke to Raghunath Das as follows. "You are just like a thief, for instead of coming near, you stay away at a distant place. Now that I have captured you, I shall punish you. Demonstrate the wonders and benefits of vaishnava-seva, make a festival and feed all My associates with yogurt and chipped rice." Hearing this, Raghunath Das was greatly pleased. 

The Panihati festival was Raghunath das Goswami's "punishment" for attempting to steal Lord Chaitanya, who is the property of Nityananda-Balaram. In other words, it was his punishment for trying to find the shelter of Lord Chaitanya without the consent of Nityananda-Balaram, Who is the proprietor of the storehouse of love of God and the only means by which to attain the Lord.
