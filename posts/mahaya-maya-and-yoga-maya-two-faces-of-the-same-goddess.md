Maha-maya, the goddess of material energy, activates the physical worlds and keeps the jiva souls bound in the shackles of passion and ignorance. She is very subtle yet extremely powerful. 

So perfect is the illusion she casts over the conditioned souls that not a single person even wants to escape from the prison-house of material existence. We are so attached to our chains and bondage that we feel no desire for true freedom. But, on the contrary, in the prison houses created by man, someone always attempts to break free. How mighty the goddess of the material energy is and how bewildering is her spell!  

Maha-maya separates the living entity from the Lord's shelter by deluding him into thinking he is the independent enjoyer, controller, and proprietor. However, as the expansion of the goddess of Bhakti, who reigns over the spiritual sky, Mayadevi ultimately desires our deliverance from material clutches. She is both our imprisoner and our well-wisher.

Her counterpart, Yoga-maya, the spiritual potency of the Lord, facilitates the union between the individual souls and Krishna. Both maha-maya and yoga-maya, serve Krishna and govern jivas according to their desires and are, in truth, different faces of the same person. 

The lens we look through determines the face we see, which could be either exploitative or devotional, according to our attitude. But, if that lens is the crystal-clear glass of being the humble servant of the servant, then everything and everyone will reveal the ultimate feature of the Lord's internal energy, and yoga-maya will make the arrangements for us to reconcile with Him and return to His shelter. 

By their example, the great souls teach us how we must interact with one another and the whole environment to evoke the divine nature, yoga-maya to reveal herself as she is. Until we are deeply steeped in an attitude of humility, we need to realize material nature (maha-maya) for what she is. We must respect the concept of the inferior (material) nature as the response of Durga, Mother Parvati, to our rebellious mentality, manifested by our desires to enjoy, control, and exploit.

We need to practice here and now how to rectify this mentality. By interacting with everything as being essentially and inherently divine, we acknowledge that the inferior nature has a divine face, and our respect for her grows. And when she takes precedence over her inferior, deluding feature, we gradually perceive yoga-maya's enlightening aspect. 

Assuming the role of mother, she prepares us for returning to the land where there is no false ego, no sense of proprietorship, where service is the predominant mentality directing the lives and activities of the Lord and His servants.
