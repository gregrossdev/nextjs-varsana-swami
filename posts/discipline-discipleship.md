The efforts, austerities, and practices involved in the acceptance as a disciple do not end with initiation. Rather they begin, in a formal sense, at that point. Whatever outer challenges or inner demons we have, will be overcome by Krishna’s grace for those who persevere in their vows. It is only those who quit who will suffer defeat.

Even as the connection and dependency between the words “disciple” and “discipline” are obvious, some devotees tend to be more attentive to the fruits than the root. Disconnected from her root, the bhakti-lata will wither. However much we may balk or resist the concept, it is discipline that forms the soul of vaidhi-bhakti and reveals the heart of raganuga-bhakti in due course of time.

On the other side, becoming a worthy, humble servant of Krishna implies understanding that discipline alone is inadequate to elevate us substantially in spiritual life. Rather, discipline attracts grace and protects the tender growth of bhakti lata bija as it reaches for the sky and blossoms into love of God.

Discipline applies to four levels of spiritual development, each successively deeper and subtler: body, mind, words, and emotions. Herein lies the comparison of the outcome of a disciple’s life in contrast to an undisciplined one.

**Disciplined life**

Character development

Choosing the right course, though it may be challenging

Setting priorities

Practicing selflessness

Service attitude

Seeking solutions

Driven from within

Walking the talk

Overcoming obstacles

Be more satisfied with less

Yearning to hear the master say, “Well done, my good and faithful servant.”

Approaching the dawn of suddha-nama

Honoring the rules and regulations which award and protect our freedom

Committed relationships

Fixed on the long-term goal, graduating from the school of material life

Firm in aspiration

Awakening of spiritual sentiments

Fixed in the self

The hope which looks upward

Faith which leads forward

**Undisciplined life**

Controlled and enslaved by emotions

Pursuing the easy, convenient, and comfortable route

Following moods

Embracing selfishness

Enjoying propensity

Making excuses

Influenced from without

Lip service alone

Procrastinating or quitting

Attached to niceties

Complaining along the way

Content with approval from worldly souls

Lingering in the shadows of nama-abhasa
