In 1974, my spiritual enthusiasm increased as Srila Prabhupada inundated us with new nectar – the printing of the entire Caitanya-caritamrta, which was then coming to light for the first time in the English language. Whenever a new volume arrived fresh off the printing press, I would read and relish it from cover to cover. I hid in the barn's corn crib to avoid being detected or interrupted in reading during work hours, which was strictly prohibited by the management. Nestled in amongst the golden corn kernels, I imbibed the message of Lord Gauranga, the Golden Avatar.

The arrival of the seventeen volumes of Caitanya-caritamrta within two months sparked a revolution in consciousness by opening a dimension of Srila Prabhupada's movement that had not been revealed before – the sacramental nature of agriculture. Being a plowboy from a farming background, I was so charmed by Srila Prabhupada's translations and purports describing Lord Caitanya as a gardener, delivering His fruits and flowers of devotional service to this world.

Within this framework, "cultivating the field" means preparing the heart. "Planting the seed" means impregnating the fertile heart with the bhakti-lata-bija. "Humility" means humus, the fertile soil where the seed can take root. The "necessary rains" are the spiritual sacrifices we perform. The "wind whispering through the growing vine" is the breath of life, the Holy Name, and the "harvest festival" is coming together to share the fruits of the spirit in nama-sankirtana.

It has long been known, even to western theologians, that the pen of spiritual authors is an expansion of the original sacramental plow. In this light, creating lines on the page parallels the plowing of furrows in a field, opening and softening terrestrial regions for cultivation before planting seeds. The spiritual author softens and prepares the heart, then plants the seed, the Word of God. By the grace of the guru who uses his pen as a plow, we can experience the mercy of Sri Baladeva, Who uses His plow to soften the hardness of our hearts.

Faithful theologians are aware of this reality and thus submit their hearts, like an open field, to be impregnated by the seed of truth. The rare person who knows and loves his Lord, therefore wishing to share that love, draws others into the wake of the furrow. In doing so, they follow in the footsteps of Sri Guru, Who guides the plow. 

I found it intriguing that such a grasp of the sacramental dynamics of agriculture could be found in a sadhu from Calcutta. Clearly, the culture Srila Prabhupada represents is not of this world.

The culture of Vraja overflows with the flavor of bhakti and instills prema in those whom it touches. The essence of vraja-prema is the life force flowing through the branch of Sri Rupa Goswami. Sri Rupa alone could detect the essence of love contained in the infinite depths of Lord Caitanya's heart. Srila Prabhupada is the perfect Rupanuga. He presents the crystallized form of the bhava flowing through that line, composed scientifically, which even logical, rational minds can appreciate and follow.

In Srila Prabhupada's spirit of humility, surrender, and sacrifice, the seed of Lord Caitanya's love found the fertile soil it needed to establish roots for a worldwide movement. Srila Prabhupada came to deliver mercy to us, and for this blessing, we praise him. Furthermore, we are solely and forever indebted to him for the teachings of the Golden Avatar. Without his contribution, who would have ever known the glories of Lord Caitanya, the most unique, merciful, and rare incarnation of Godhead.
